#1
The "accuarcy" attribute has been renamed "accuracy".

#10
The languageDeclaration element is now repeatable.

#11
The agencyName element is now repeatable.

#12
The eventDescription element is now repeatable.

#13
The sourceEntry element is now repeatable.

#16
The otherAgencyCode element data type has been changed from xs:NMTOKEN to xs:token, relaxing the restriction so that spaces and commas are allowed. This differs from EAD3, which is more permissive and allows text, but since this element does not permit mixed content that level of permissiveness should be unnecessary.

#17
The placeEntry element is now repeatable within each of the relation elements.

#19
The preferredForm element data type has been changed from xs:NMTOKEN to xs:token for reasons similar to issue #16.  In this case, however, there is no equivalent element in EAD3.

#31
The localType attribute has been added to the fromDate and toDate elements.

#33
The maxInclusive parameters have been removed from the standardDate and standardDateTime attributes. This means that attribute values with years greater than 2999 are now valid.

#46
A new element, rightsDeclaration, has been added to control. This element is patterned off of the rightsdeclaration element that was added to EAD3 version 1.1.0.

#47
The value 'unknown' is now a valid option for the eventType element.

#48
The value 'unknown' is now a valid option for the agentType element.

#49
The value 'published' is now a valid option for the publicationStatus element.

#50
The value 'deletedMerged' is now a valid option for the maintenanceStatus element.
